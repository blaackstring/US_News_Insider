      "JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can execute only one piece of code at a time. Yet, it handles asynchronous operations like API calls and timers effortlessly. This magic happens because of the Event Loop.",
      "The event loop works with the Call Stack, Web APIs, Callback Queue, and Microtask Queue. When async code runs, it is offloaded to Web APIs, freeing the call stack.",
      "Promises use the microtask queue, which has higher priority than the callback queue. That’s why `Promise.then()` executes before `setTimeout`.",
      "Understanding the event loop is essential for debugging performance issues and avoiding UI freezes.",
      "Once mastered, you can write non-blocking, high-performance JavaScript applications.",
      "Node.js uses the event loop for server-side concurrency.",
